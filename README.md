# Homework-_1

Your task in Assignment 1 is to organize the Netflix data into Dataframes that Python can progrm later on.
You may find the data description here:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data

Hint: find the raw data of Netflix and convert them into CSV files with 5 columns (MovieID,  Movie Title,  User ID, Date, Rating). Then, you can load to Python directly. Given the size of the Netflix data, you may need to create multiple CSV files and multiple DataFrames.
Report: I would like to see how you organize the data effectively. I would like to see you to spend efforts on testing the limit of CSV files with the large scale of the Netflix data (example. what is maximum number of records that CSV file can handle smoothly), and the limit of DataFrames as well (i.e., what is the maximum limit that DataFrames by Python can hold).  

Submission: due 5:00pm Oct 15, 2022.   Report should summarize your work and findings, show screenshots of your data and program.
